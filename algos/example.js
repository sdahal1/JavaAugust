//most improved- be the most improved that day, not the most advanced, and not the fastest, and not the most efficient. Comparison is the thief of joy!
//focus on figuring out the outputs from the inputs
//those steps you took to figure out the output without ussing code, see fi you can explain what you did in english
//from those english steps, see if you can make it sound liek dorky logical english where you might mention some programming terms like variables and loops, conditionals
//eventually try to code it out, if time runs out, its okay. give your self permission to know that its okay and give yourself some love for trying during that time and being on the path to be the most improved

//when algos are being explained, ask about any part of the process that you had difficculty in either translating to pseudocode, regular code, or even english.
// make sure you have several different solutions from the discord and instructor and ta and keep them handy in an algos folder which you will use after the bootcamp or any free time

//put in 60+ hours/week during the bootcamp and even after

//during your free time to work on algos, put a solution in python tutor: http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit   and visualize the code
//then try the algos without looking at the solutions, and if you get it wrong, try again
